## **Section 2: Machine Learning 101**

- What Is Machine Learning?
  - Machines can perform tasks really fast
  - We give them instructions to do tasks and they do it for us
  - Computers used to mean people who do tasks that compute
  - Problem: How to get to Danielle's house using Google maps?
  - Imagine we had ten different routes to Danielle's house
    - Option 1: I measure each route one by one 
    - Option 2: I program and tell the computer to calculate these 10 routes and find the shortest one.
  - Problem: Somebody left a review on Amazon. Is this person angry?
  - How can I describe to a computer what angry means?
  - We let machines take care of the easier part of which things we can describe
  - Things that are hard to just give instructions to, we let human do it
  - The goal of machine learning is to make machines act more and more like humans because the smarter they
- [AI/Machine Learning/Data Science](A Beginner’s Guide To Data Science)
  - AI: machine that acts like human
  - Narrow AI: machine that acts like human at a specific task
  - General AI: machine that acts like human with multiple abilities
  - Machine Learning: a subset of AI
  - Machine Learning: an approach to achieve artificial intelligence through systems that can find patterns in a set of data
  - Machine Learning: the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed
  - Deep Learning: a subset of Machine Learning
  - Deep Learning: one of the techniques for implementing machine learning
  - Data Science: analyzing data and then doing something with a business goal
