## **Section 2: Machine Learning 101**

- What Is Machine Learning?
  - Machines can perform tasks really fast
  - We give them instructions to do tasks and they do it for us
  - Computers used to mean people who do tasks that compute
  - Problem: How to get to Danielle's house using Google maps?
  - Imagine we had ten different routes to Danielle's house
    - Option 1: I measure each route one by one 
    - Option 2: I program and tell the computer to calculate these 10 routes and find the shortest one.
  - Problem: Somebody left a review on Amazon. Is this person angry?
  - How can I describe to a computer what angry means?
  - We let machines take care of the easier part of which things we can describe
  - Things that are hard to just give instructions to, we let human do it
  - The goal of machine learning is to make machines act more and more like humans because the smarter they
- [AI/Machine Learning/Data Science](A Beginner’s Guide To Data Science)
  - AI: machine that acts like human
  - Narrow AI: machine that acts like human at a specific task
  - General AI: machine that acts like human with multiple abilities
  - Machine Learning: a subset of AI
  - Machine Learning: an approach to achieve artificial intelligence through systems that can find patterns in a set of data
  - Machine Learning: the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed
  - Deep Learning: a subset of Machine Learning
  - Deep Learning: one of the techniques for implementing machine learning
  - Data Science: analyzing data and then doing something with a business goal
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- How Did We Get Here?
  - Goal: Make business decisions
  - Spreadsheets -> Relational DB -> Big Data (NoSQL) -> Machine Learning
    - Massive amounts of data
    - Massive improvements in computation
  - Steps in a full machine learning project
    - Data collection (hardest part) -> Data modelling -> Deployment
    - Data collection
      - How to clean noisy data?
      - What can we grab data from?
      - How do we find data?
      - How do we clean it so we can actually learn from it?
      - How to turn data from useless to useful?
    - Data modelling
      - Problem definition: What problem are we trying to solve?
      - Data: What data do we have?
      - Evaluation: What defines success?
      - Features: What features should we model?
      - Modelling: What kind of model should we use?
      - Experiments: What have we tried / What else can we try?
- [Machine Learning Playground](https://ml-playground.com)
- [Types of Machine Learning](http://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/): predict results based on incoming data
  - Supervised: Data are labeled into categories
    - classification: is this an apple or is this a pear?
    - regression: based on input to predict stock prices
  - Unsupervised: Data don't have labels
    - clustering: machine to create these groups
    - association rule learning: associate different things to predict what a customer might buy in the future
  - Reinforcement: teach machines through trial and error 
  - Reinforcement: teach machines through rewards and punishment
    - skill acquisition
    - real time learning
- What Is Machine Learning? Round 2
  - Now: Data -> machine learning algorithm -> pattern
  - Future: New data -> Same algorithm (model) -> More patterns
  - Normal algorithm: Starts with inputs and steps -> Makes output
  - Machine learning algorithm
    - Starts with inputs and output -> Figures out the steps
  - Data analysis is looking at a set of data and gain an understanding of it by comparing different examples, different features and making visualizations like graphs
  - Data science is running experiments on a set of data with the hopes of finding actionable insights within it
    - One of these experiments is to build a machine learning model
  - Data Science = Data analysis + Machine learning
